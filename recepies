Maqluba With Eggplant and Lamb


Directions:

 

Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a saucepan, add onions and lamb chops and stir over a medium heat for couple of minutes. Season with salt, black pepper, allspices, cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaf. Add 4 cups of water, cover the pot and let simmer until cooked (cooking time varies from an hour to two and half, depending on meat type).

Meanwhile, heat the rest of vegetable oil in large frying pan. Add eggplant slices and sauté both sides until golden brown. Place them on paper towel to absorb oil and set side.

In a big pot, add a small pinch of rice (to avoid burning of the meat). Arrange lamb chops, tomato slices, eggplant slices in layers. Pour lamb stock, and then add rice. Add a small pinch of salt (optional). Bring the pot to a boil over a medium heat. Then cover it and turn the heat down to low and let simmer until rice is cooked (from 20 to 30 minutes).

Leave the pot to cool for 15 to 20 minutes, and then carefully flip it up-side down over a serving platter. Serve hot with fresh yogurt or Arabic salad.


Ingredients

    half cup vegetable oil, divided
    1 onion, finely chopped
    half kilo lamb, cut in medium-size chops
    salt to taste
    1.5 teaspoon allspice
    half teaspoon black pepper
    1 tablespoon cinnamon
    3 cardamom, crushed
    1 bay leaf
    1 kilo eggplant, peeled and sliced
    3 tomatoes, sliced
    1.5 cup rice, thoroughly washed

When I come to think of the national dish of Palestine, I think of musakhan (layered dish of bread, onion and sumac topped with chicken and pine nut). But many others would think of maqluba.

Maqluba (means upside down in Arabic) is a very popular dish among Palestinians and Jordanians alike, they get really excited when it’s served on the table. It’s basically a layered pot of meat, vegetables and rice. Cooked all together and then flipped over a serving big flat platter, making this beautiful cake-like form.

Maqluba has a couple of variations in ingredients ; some make it with chicken and cauliflower, some prefer it with lamb and eggplant, while some others make it with cauliflower and eggplant, and add other vegetables like potatoes, tomatoes, and green peppers. Vegetables can be deep fried or just slightly sautéed. It can be with or without meat.

2.Stuffed Date Maamoul

Directions:

For the dough: place flour, olive oil, sesame seeds, anise, black seeds and instant yeast  in a medium-size bowl.  Rub the mixture using both hands and knead the dough until oil is well combined into the flour. Place the mixture in the refrigerator for a while. (In some recipes, it's left in the refrigerator for overnight. I only leave it for half an hour).

Add 1/3 cup of water gradually to the mixture while kneading. Keep kneading the dough until it's well combined. (Add more water if the dough is too dry or flour if it is too sticky). Cover the bowl with plastic bag and leave it for about an hour to rest.

For the stuffing: combine date paste, anise, and cardamom and mix very well. cut the dough into several pieces and roll them into snake shape (roughly half cm). leave a side.

For rolling and filling process: cut the dough into ten pieces. Gently roll each of dough pieces into a snake shape, then make it flat with your hands (roughly 1 cm thickness). Fill it with date paste pieces (as in pictures). Fold the dough and seal the edges very well. Using a knife, cut stuffed dough into 2 cm pieces.  Bring both corners of each filled-dough piece together in order to make the final form of maamoul.

Place them in an oven tray and put it in a preheated oven (180 degrees Celsius in the middle level rack) for a total of 15 minutes, 10 minutes for below side and 5 for above side or until they barely start getting golden. (Be aware not to over cook them). Take them out of the oven, let them cool and then place them in a closed container.


Ingredients

    Dough:
    250 grams all purpose flour
    1/2 cup olive oil
    1 tablespoon sesame seeds
    1 tablespoon anise seeds
    1 tablespoon anise, powdered
    1 tablespoon black seeds
    1 teaspoon instant yeast
    Date Filling:
    200 gram date paste*
    1 teaspoon anise seeds
    1 teaspoon anise, powdered
    1 teaspoon cardamom, crushed



 story:It’s been long time since the last time we made homemade Maamoul. I even can’t remember when that was exactly. Definitely more than 10 years ago when we used to live next door to my grandmother’s house, where my aunts, mother and grandmother would gather days ahead of Eid. Each one of them would bring her share of Maamoul ingredients and different shapes of Maamoul molds. They would sit on the kitchen floor making a circle; each of them is responsible for doing a certain step of the whole process repetitively. Kneading, rolling, stuffing, molding, baking, packing…  I wish I had a single picture of all this.

Holding this memory, I’ve always had the impression that making Maamoul requires a number of people and a long time. The impression has changed just yesterday when I’ve decided to try to make stuffed date maamoul by myself with some help of my mom. The whole process didn’t take more than two hours. And a good time was already wasted in trying to convince my mom to make it in the first place. “Only for the sake of the blog” she kept saying!

The recipe I’m sharing with you in this post is provided by the cook of the Palestinian Cultural Center in Amman. They make the best yet the healthier Maamoul in town.

Enjoy baking! and Eid Mubarak for all who are celebrating Eid in some way or another…

Meat Dumplings in Yogurt Sauce (Shishbarak)

Directions:

For the Dough: In a medium size bowl, combine flour, olive oil, vegetable oil, and salt. Rub the mixture together until oil is well combined into the flour. Add half cup of warm water gradually while kneading using one hand (add more water if the dough is dry or flour if it is too sticky). Add some vegetable oil to your both hands and try to form the dough to a ball and then cut it into hand-size balls. Cover the bowel for about 10 minutes to rest.

For the Filling: Meanwhile, in a frying pan, add olive oil and onion and stir for couple of minutes until onion becomes slightly golden in color. Add meat, cover the pan and leave it on a reduced heat for about 10 minutes or until meat is cooked. Stir from time to time.

For the Dumplings: Roll each of dough balls on a soft and floured surface using a rolling pin. Cut the rolled dough into thin circles using an inverted small glass (the smaller is the glass, the smaller is the dumpling). Add meat filling to each circle of dough and fold it into half. Seal the edges very well. Bring both corners of the filled dough together in order to make a proper form of shishbarak dumpling. Place all dumplings in a tray and put it in a preheated oven for 8 minutes (4 minutes for each side, above and below).

Ingredients

    Dough Ingredients:
    2 cups white flour
    2 tablespoon vegetable oil
    2 tablespoon olive oil
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    Filling Ingredients:
    1 tablespoon olive oil
    1 onion, finely chopped
    250 gram beef, finely minced (substitute: lamb)
    1/4 teaspoon mixed spices (black pepper, ginger, turmeric)
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    Yogurt Ingredients:
    1 kilogram set yogurt
    1 tablespoon cornstarch
    1/4 cup rice, soaked for 15 minutes
    1 cube chicken stock
    4 garlic clove, minced
    3 tablespoon fresh coriander 

In some areas of Palestine it is called (taqiyet elyahoodi) which means Jew’s hat, in some other areas it’s called (dinen) which means ears. However, the mainly and commonly used term is Shishbarak or Shushbarak. Although it is a very old dish that it’s believed to be originated hundreds years ago, shishbarak is still considered as one of the distinctive dishes of Levantine cuisine nowadays.

Shishbarak is a light and mild main-dish that takes hours of preparation. Mainly consists of small pieces of beef-stuffed dough cooked in yogurt sauce, flavored with fried garlic and seasoned with fresh coriander.

The recipe that I’m sharing in this post belongs to my mother’s friend Aysheh who was born and raised in Damascus, originally from Haifa and now living in Amman. She invited me to her kitchen and chose her favorite dish to share with everyone…

1.A trio of Labneh
ingredients:
 Makes 10 - 12 balls

    350 g Turkish or Greek (set) yogurt
    Salt, to taste
    Greek herb mix – a dried blend of oregano, basil, thyme, mint and parsley
    Nut mix – like Dukkah, Za'atar or crushed nuts like (flaked almonds) with chopped fresh mint, coriander
    Suya mix – ground peanuts with a mixture of paprika, chilli, ginger powder, onion powder, garlic powder and salt
    To serve, pita chips, acacia honey (great with the nutty version), mugs of mint tea


    PREPARE THE YOGURT: stir the yogurt well and season with salt. The salt helps draw out the whey (think of cucumbers& aubergines where the salt drains them of their natural liquids). If you want to use this in a ‘sweet’ recipe, temper how much salt you add.
    BAG AND HANG: place the yogurt in the centre of a muslin/cheesecloth folded 4 times (or line a sieve with coffee filters). Gather up the ends of the cloth and tie up tight, gently gathering up the yogurt to form a ball. You’ll notice the whey begin to drip as soon as you begin. (Keep the whey in the fridge stir into your breakfast cereal, or back into yogurt, in pancake mixes...or find out a myriad other ways to use it – it is rich in protein, and remember Little Miss Muffet?)
    Moving on, pass a skewer through the tie/knot and hang over a deep bowl. Some people leave it to hang at room temperature but for hygiene issues, I place my yogurt over a bowl, in the fridge overnight. The next morning, much of the whey will have drained out, leaving a creamy residue - firm on the outside andsoft and creamy on the inside.
    If you like, you can serve it now, gently stirred together and topped with anything from olives and tomatoes to herbs and spice mixes.
    MAKE LABNEH BALLS: put your spice mixes in bowls. The amount you need will vary according to preferences. Pinch off chunks of cheese, dunk them in the spices, then gently roll them to form balls. This will reduce the amount of cheese that sticks to your fingers, though note that a bowl of water close by is very handy.
    For the Almond mix, gently mix some chopped fresh mint in the labneh, using the tips of your fingers and minimising the stickiness and loss associated with wet foods. Pinch off cheese chunks and roll them in the crushed almonds or dukkah mix.



2.Israeli Tahini Cookies:

ingredients:
 Original recipe makes 24 servings

    3 cups all-purpose flour

    1 cup white sugar

    2 teaspoons baking powder

    14 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

    1 cup tahini


Directions

    Preheat oven to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with waxed paper.
    Mix flour, sugar, and baking powder together in a large bowl; add butter and tahini and mix until dough is crumbly. Roll dough into small balls and press each ball into a flattened cookie shape using your palms. Arrange cookies in the prepared baking sheet and press with a fork.
    Place the baking sheet on the middle rack of the oven and bake until cookies are golden, about 10 minutes. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 2 to 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

story:

A quick and simple Middle Eastern/Mediterranean hit. I've seen both little Jewish grandmothers in Jerusalem make these cookies and Bedouin women living in the middle of the desert. A great simple recipe that isn't too sweet, is very versatile and fast. Enjoy."


3.Israeli Couscous with Grilled Summer Vegetables:

ingredients:

1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
1/2 tsp Dijon mustard
1 clove garlic, chopped
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Salt & pepper
1/2 pound green beans, trimmed
1 zucchini, quartered lengthwise
1 yellow squash, quartered lengthwise
1 red bell pepper, seeded and quartered
1 tbsp olive oil
8 oz. Israeli couscous
1 3/4 cups vegetable broth
1/4 cup fresh basil, chiffonaded, plus a sprig for garnishing
2 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley


directions:

In a small bowl, combine the balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, and chopped garlic; whisk together. While continuously whisking, slowly pour in 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper.  Combine all of the prepared vegetables in a large dish and toss with half of the vinaigrette.  Let the vegetables rest for 15 minutes.
Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.  Brush the grill lightly with oil. Place all of the vegetables on the grill, setting the green beans on a vegetable rack. If you don’t have a vegetable rack, you can either put the green beans directly on the grill (a little risky) or saute them in a skillet.  Cook until the vegetables are just cooked through. The green beans will be done before the rest of the vegetables, so be certain to watch them closely.  Remove the vegetables from the grill and cut the zucchini, yellow squash, and red bell pepper into 1/2-inch pieces, and place them in a large bowl with the green beans.
Heat 1 3/4 cups vegetable broth in small saucepan.  Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat. Add 8 oz. Israeli couscous and stir constantly until the couscous is lightly golden brown.  Slowly pour in the heated broth, reduce the heat to medium-low and cover. Cook until the couscous is al dente, about 12 minutes. If you find that the couscous is not quite done, but not all of the liquid is absorbed, add 1-2 tablespoons of hot water and cook until the liquid is absorbed.
Pour the couscous into the bowl with the vegetables, along with basil chiffonade (simply roll the leaves and thinly slice) and chopped flat-leaf parsley.  Spoon into a serving dish and garnish with a sprig of fresh basil.
Serves 4.

Italian stuffed chicken

ingredients

    2 tbsp chopped olives or sundried tomatoes - whatever you've got
    1 garlic clove, crushed
    ½ tsp dried mixed herbs
    200g tub full-fat soft cheese
    4 plump boneless, skinless chicken breasts
    4 ripe tomatoes, sliced
    olive oil, for drizzling
directins:
    Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Beat the olives or sundried tomatoes, garlic and almost all the herbs into the cheese, then season. Cut a slit along the side of each chicken breast, then use your knife to open it out into a pocket.
    Stuff each breast with a quarter of the cheese mix, then press to close. Lift onto a greased baking tray. Season the top of the chicken, then overlap tomato slices over the top of each piece of chicken. Season, then scatter with the remaining herbs. Drizzle with olive oil.
    Roast for 20 mins until the chicken is golden around the edges and the tomatoes look a little shrivelled. Serve with a green salad and crusty bread to mop up the juices.


2.Nettle gnudi with wild pesto


Ingredients

    2 x 250g tubs good-quality ricotta
    200g young nettle leaves (foraged - see tip)
    50g Parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), plus extra to serve
    2 egg yolks
    nutmeg, for grating
    350g semolina flour or fine semolina
    6 tbsp wild pesto (see recipe in Goes well with)
directions:
    Line a sieve with a piece of muslin and set over a bowl. Tip in the ricotta, gather up the ends of the muslin and gently tie together. Leave to drain for 4 hrs or preferably overnight.
    Meanwhile, bring a pan of water to the boil. Blanch the nettle leaves quickly, then drain and chill under the cold tap. Thoroughly drain again, and squeeze out as much water from the leaves as you can, then very finely chop and chill until needed.
    To make the gnudi, transfer the strained ricotta to a large bowl. Beat a little, then add all but a few tbsp of the Parmesan, the egg yolks, nettles, a good grating of nutmeg and plenty of seasoning. Give it a good stir to combine. Tip the semolina into a large baking tray (it will need to fit in your fridge later). Wet your hands, dip them in the semolina and, working quickly, scoop 1 heaped tsp of the ricotta mixture into your hands and gently roll into a ball. Place the ball on the semolina tray and roll around so that it is completely coated. Pick it up and roll between the palms of your hands to create a smooth ball, then put back in the semolina. Continue with the rest of the mixture – you should have about 28 balls in total. Leaving the balls in the semolina, make sure that they are well spaced, then cover loosely with cling film. Chill for 12-24 hrs – the longer the better – until a skin has formed on the gnudi.
    To cook, bring a large pan of water to the boil. Meanwhile, spoon the pesto into a frying pan. Once the water is boiling, drop in batches of the gnudi and simmer for 2-3 mins or until they rise to the surface. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and transfer to a sieve. Repeat with the remaining gnudi. Heat the pesto in the pan with a few tbsp of the gnudi cooking water, to loosen it. Tip the cooked gnudi into the frying pan and gently turn the balls in the pesto. Divide between plates and scatter over the remaining Parmesan and a good grinding of black pepper before serving.
